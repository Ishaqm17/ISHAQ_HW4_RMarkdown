## Data Structues
## Q1
```{r}
library(readr)
library(readxl)
library(rvest)

# Answer: scan, readLines, read_html, readr, and readxl functions, are all meant to read in different types of data efficeintly. These are different from previous functions we've worked with like ls which is a terminal command for listing out current options. scan() is for Reading numbers or characters in vectors. readLines() is meant for Reading text line by line in character vectors. read_html() is good for parsing web data like HTML/XML. readr is meant for fast CSV reading into dataframes and is faster than our usual read_csv() function that we work with. readxl is meant for fast Excel file reading into dataframes. 

# Example of scan()
text_data <- scan(text = "1 2 3 4 5", what = numeric())

# Example of readLines()
lines <- readLines(textConnection("This is a test\nSecond line"))

# Example of read_html()
url <- "https://www.example.com"
html_data <- read_html(url)

# Example of read_csv()
csv_data <- read_csv("data.csv")

# Example of read_excel()
excel_data <- read_excel("data.xlsx")
```

## Q2
```{r}
## S3 is the most frequently used and the most simple out of the 3.It makes creating object very simple and with less programming. As a result it is very flexible but does not account for strict regulations and makes it more optimal for for quick and easy tasks.
s3_obj <- list(name = "John", value = 1)
class(s3_obj) <- "s3_class"

# S4 is more complex and structured as it requires consistent formating through defining slots and data types. This makes it more useful for larger projects and higher level computation.
setClass("S4Class", slots = list(name = "character", value = "numeric"))
s4_obj <- new("S4Class", name = "John", value = 1)

# R6 is the most similar to object-orientated programming in other languages through having inheritance and allowing dynamic modification of objects instead of creating copies.
library(R6)
MyClass <- R6Class("MyClass",
  public = list(
    name = NULL,
    initialize = function(name) {
      self$name <- name
    }
  )
)
my_r6 <- MyClass$new("Example")
```

# R Packages and Shiny (50 points)
```{r}
library(shiny)
library(ggplot2)
library(datasets)
# Question 1: Walkthrough of K Means Shiny App


# (Document changes made at each step)
# Changes Made to `shiny_kmeans_app.Rmd`

### **Step 1: Load Required Libraries**
- Added `library(shiny)`, `library(ggplot2)`, and `library(datasets)` to support Shiny functionality, data visualization, and dataset access.

### **Step 2: Define the UI (User Interface)**
- Included `titlePanel("K-Means Clustering")` to set the app title.
- Added `selectInput()` dropdowns for choosing X and Y variables from `iris`.
- Added `numericInput()` for selecting the number of clusters.
- Defined `plotOutput("clusterPlot")` to display the clustering results.

### **Step 3: Define the Server Logic**
- Introduced `reactive()` expressions:
  - `selectedData()` dynamically retrieves the chosen variables.
  - `clusters()` applies `kmeans()` to selected data.
- Implemented `renderPlot()` to display clustering results with:
  - Data points colored by cluster assignments.
  - Cluster centers marked distinctly.

### **Step 4: Launch the Shiny App**
- Used `shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)` to run the app.

### **Step 5: Modularizing into Functions for a Custom R Package**
- **Created `compute_kmeans()` function:**
  - Computes K-means clustering on input data.
- **Created `plot_kmeans()` function:**
  - Generates a scatter plot of clusters using the computed model.
- **Updated the Shiny server to call these functions** instead of embedding the logic directly.

### **Step 6: Created R Package `KMeansClustering`**
- Used `devtools::create("KMeansClustering")` to generate the package structure.
- Placed functions inside `R/compute_kmeans.R` and `R/plot_kmeans.R`.
- Documented functions with `roxygen2`.
- Installed and tested the package using `devtools::document()` and `devtools::install()`.

### **Step 7: Added Unit Tests**
- Created `tests/testthat/test_kmeans.R`.
- Wrote `test_that()` checks to validate K-means clustering results.
- Ran `devtools::test()` to ensure correctness.

### **Final Adjustments**
- Ensured the Shiny app correctly referenced the **new package functions**.
- Verified all components were functional and optimized.

# Question 2: K Means R Package
compute_kmeans <- function(data, clusters) {
  kmeans(data, centers = clusters)
}

plot_kmeans <- function(data, clusters) {
  km <- compute_kmeans(data, clusters)
  plot(data, col = km$cluster, pch = 20, cex = 2)
  points(km$centers, pch = 4, cex = 4, lwd = 4)
}
